                <h4 class="the-story-text">I had a graphic design career for fifty years and am now in recovery from
                    that
                    career. I did some
                    silk screen in college in the 1960s, a few prints in the 1980s and then nothing until 2019 when I
                    built a set up for silk screen in the garden level of my design studio.<br><br>Although very small,
                    the studio affords me the luxury of having every thing I need to silkscreen in one place. With the
                    exception of outputting film, which is done by the fine folks at Anthem in San Francisco, I do
                    everything by hand for each print.<br><br>The allure of silkscreen for me is the smooth and vibrant
                    color along with the crisp delineation of form.</h4>

        <h3 class="the-process-header">The Process</h3>
        <h4 class="the-process-text">Stencils are required to define the inking areas. To create the stencils I
            use one of two techniques. I hand cut paper stencils or screens are coated with a photo emulsion,
            exposed to UV light, then washed out with a high pressure water spray. One screen is needed for each color
            to be printed.<br><br>Custom colors are mixed for each print, and tested beforehand on the edition
            paper.<br><br>As each color is printed the sheets are hung up to dry for a day before going on to
            the next color.<br><br>Although the process seems very mechanical, I’m finding there are always
            printer’s gremlins that want to fool with the process so that adjustments are required on the fly. Little
            victories when you can adjust for them, very disappointing when you can not.<br><br>With small
            prints my loss rate is around 10%, with large format multicolor prints my loss rate is closer to 50%. Thus
            the high cost of large multicolor prints.</h4>
